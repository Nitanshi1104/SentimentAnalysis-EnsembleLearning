# SentimentAnalysis-EnsembleLearning
Twitter has emerged as an essential platform for disseminating up-to-the-minute information on emergencies in the current digital landscape. Nevertheless, separating true accounts of the calamity from the morass of inaccurate information continues to be a challenging task. In order to solve this problem, our study uses a combination of natural language processing and machine learning in order to reliably identify between fake and legitimate tweets about disasters. We addressed issues like noise and linguistic mistakes by refining user-generated content by using a sample of 10,000 tweets that had been rigorously selected and curated. Our ensemble approach, which included the SVC, Catboost, and Naive Bayes algorithms, not only got an impressive accuracy of 82.6% but also a ROC of 0.814, an MCC of 0.644, and an F1 Score of 0.78. Our findings highlight the novel potential of algorithmic surveillance on Twitter by bridging the gap between human intuition and machine comprehension. This paves the door for fast, informed responses to natural disasters and helps strengthen a resilient digital society.
